# Bird Hunt Game

**Bird Hunt** is a 3D browser-based game developed as part of a Computer Graphics course. The project is built using **WebGL** and **OpenGL**, following the course's goal of teaching how to design, engineer, and develop computer graphics software for various applications, including **scientific visualization**, **simulation**, and **gaming**.

## Game Overview

In **Bird Hunt**, as the name suggests, the player’s goal is to hunt down a bird in a virtual environment. The game's user interface (UI) takes inspiration from the popular **Angry Birds** game, with a similar aesthetic style reflected in the bird icon and font design.

### Main Features:
- **Difficulty Levels**: Players can choose between three difficulty levels—easy, medium, and hard.
- **Environments**: The game offers three distinct environments: **Woodland**, **Winterland**, and **Desertland**. Hovering over each environment provides a preview, and the background music changes accordingly to enhance the user experience (UX). Players can toggle the background music on or off based on their preference.
- **Scoreboard**: After each game, the top five players’ scores are displayed, encouraging competition.

### How to Play:
- Click the button on the bottom left to open the settings modal.
- Choose your difficulty level and game environment.
- Background music will automatically adapt to the chosen environment, adding an immersive element to the gameplay.
- Start hunting the bird in the selected environment!
